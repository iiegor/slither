![This is currently under extremely active development, and you probably shouldn't use it unless you like broken software.](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B9WchF8WhEn9YTZnQkZvNzMzaDg "This is currently under extremely active development, and you probably shouldn't use it unless you like broken software.")

This is supposed to be an open source implementation of the slither server built on top of Node.js that emulates the full functionality of the original server.

## Install
You can get the latest stable release from the [releases](https://github.com/iiegor/slither/releases) page. Once you've downloaded it, you are ready to run the following commands:
```sh
$ cd slither
$ npm install
```
Obviously, if you want to try the latest version, you can clone the master branch but can have bugs because it's a development branch, so don't use it for production.

The server depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](http://npmjs.org/) and other packages that are downloaded and installed during the installation process.

## Run
You can start the server by executing ``$ script/run`` or ``$ npm start``.

The server will be accesible at ``localhost:8080`` but you will need a client (you can use the original one) to be able to play the game.

## Plugins
If you want to install a plugin, add it to ``packageDependencies`` in the package.json with the respective version.

```json
{
  ...
  "packageDependencies": {
    "my-plugin": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```
and run ``$ script/install``.
